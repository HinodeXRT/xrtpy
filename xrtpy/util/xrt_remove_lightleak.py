def xrt_remove_lightleak(in_map, kfact=1.0, leak_image=None, verbose=False):
    r"""
    Subtract light leak (visible stray light) image from XRT synoptic
    composite images.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    in_map : ~sunpy.map.sources.hinode.XRTMap
        |Map| for the synoptic composite image which the visible stray light
        will be subtracted from

    kfact : float, default: 1.0
        k-factor to apply when subtracting the light leak image:
        ``out_data = in_data - k * [leak_img]``


    leak_image : float array, dimensions 1024x1024,  optional
        A leak image to subtract, if a non-default image is desired.
        It's assumed that the image is 1024x1024, prepped and exposure
        normalized.

    verbose : `bool`, default: `False`
        If `True`, print out extra messages.

    Returns:
    --------
    out_map : ~sunpy.map.sources.hinode.XRTMap
        |Map| of input image with the light leak removed. The metadata HISTORY
        is also updated to reflect the fact that the light leak was removed.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> file = ``"comp_XRT20200220_061539.6.fits"`` # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> in_map = Map(file) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> out_map =xrt_remove_lightleak(in_map) # doctest: +SKIP

    Notes:
    ------
    (Taken from the IDL routine :file:`xrt_synleaksub.pro`)
    1. XRT images obtained after 9-May-2021 suffer visible stray light
    contamination (light leak) due to the pre-filter failure, i.e.  tiny
    rupture development occurred multiple times as follows:

    phase 1 :  9-May-2012 12:00
    phase 2 : 14-Jun-2015 12:30
    phase 3 : 27-May-2017 11:00
    phase 4 : 29-May-2018 00:00
    phase 5 :  8-Jun-2022 12:40

    2. The light leak correction is done by simply subtracting the light leak
    image (visible stray light component included in each X-ray filter pair)
    obtained during the Hinode satellite's eclipse season, which occurs
    roughly May to August each year.  The light leak image has the following
    characteristics:

    * Leak pattern and intensity differ with each filter and also with the
      satellite pointing.
    * Leak pattern and intensity of the same filter and pointing are roughly
      constant during each stray light phase (above), but vary by ~10%
      depending on the growth of the contamination layer on the CCD (that
      repeats gradual increase and jump down after CCD bakeouts).

    3. The image for the light leak correction should therefore be selected
    for the same filter, same satellite pointing, same stray light phase then
    ideally be adjusted for the level of CCD contamination at the time of
    observation.  However, as a practical matter, preparing the leak image for
    every possible pointing is hard to achieve, while we have good amount of
    light leak measurements at the disk center pointing. The full-disk
    composite images are therefore corrected most reliably for the light leak.

    4. Intensity variation of the leak image due to the growth of CCD
    contamination layer is well determined for Ti_poly at the stray light
    phase 1 by using the intensity correlation between Ti_poly and Al_mesh
    images (cg. :cite:p:`Takeda:2016`, p.317). The resulting
    k-factor is obtained with the function :file:`GET_SLCORFACT_RAW.PRO`, and the leak
    image subtraction has been already performed only for the Ti_poly SCIA
    images at the phase 1 (as of Feb-2022).

   open
      Visible light shutter during exposure as name
   temperature
      Temperature :math:`T`, is a `~astropy.units.Quantity` with units of temperature (e.g., kelvin)
   temperature response
      Instrument temperature response function, peremission measure,for a filter-channel c. Units are [DN cm^5 s−1pix−1]
   solar-emission-spectra
      A set of plasma emission spectra for a set of temperature. The XRT software uses the CHIANTI solar model by default. XRTpy
      has future plans of integrating users to add their own solar model ( realted to the temperature response ).

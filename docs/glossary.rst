   DN
      Data number (DN) per unit.

   Contamination (related to the XRT)
      Contaminating material has accumulated on the XRT CCD and focal plane filters (FPFs), causing a decrease in sensitivity.
      Refer to Section 2.5.3 `Contamination` in the `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ in the `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ for
      more information about the XRT contamination.

   Temperature response
      Instrument temperature response function, for a filter-channel. Units are
      DN cm\ :sup:`5` s\ :sup:`âˆ’1` pix\ :sup:`-1`\ .

   Solar-emission-spectra
      A set of plasma emission spectra for a set of temperature.

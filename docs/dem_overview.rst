Introduction
------------
The **Differential Emission Measure (DEM)** describes how much plasma is present 
in the solar corona as a function of temperature.  
It is a key diagnostic for understanding coronal heating, solar flares, and 
general plasma properties.

Hinode/XRT is particularly well suited for DEM analysis because of its multiple 
broadband filters, which are sensitive to different temperature ranges.

Why DEM?
--------
- Converts observed X-ray intensities into a thermal distribution of plasma.
- Allows comparison across instruments (e.g., Hinode/XRT, SDO/AIA, Hinode/EIS).
- Provides a physical link between observations and coronal heating models.

DEM in XRTpy
------------
XRTpy provides a Python implementation of the iterative spline-fitting method 
(originally available in IDL as `xrt_dem_iterative2.pro`).  

The DEM workflow requires three main inputs, each with specific type, shape, and units:

1. **Observed channels (filters)**  
    - Type: ``str`` or ``list`` of ``str``  
    - Description: Names of the filters used in the observation (e.g., ``"Al-mesh"``, ``"Be-thin"``).  

2. **Observed intensities**  
    - Type: array-like  
    - Units: DN/s (normalized per pixel)  
    - Description: Measured intensities corresponding to each filter.  

3. **Temperature response functions**  
    - Type: ``list`` of :class:`~xrtpy.response.fundamentals.TemperatureResponseFundamental`  
    - Units: DN s\ :sup:`-1` pix\ :sup:`-1` EM\ :sup:`-1`  
    - Description: Instrument temperature responses matching the filters.  
        These can be generated with :func:`xrtpy.response.tools.generate_temperature_responses`.  
        See :doc:`getting_started` for details.

Example
-------
A simple example with two filters:

.. code-block:: python

    from xrtpy.response.tools import generate_temperature_responses
    from xrtpy.xrt_dem_iterative import XRTDEMIterative

    # Define filters and observed intensities
    filters = ["Al-poly","C-poly/Ti-poly"]
    intensities = [250.0, 180.0]  # DN/s

    # Generate responses
    responses = generate_temperature_responses(
        filters, 
        observation_date="2007-07-10", 
        abundance_model="hybrid"
        )

    # Solve XRT DEM
    dem_solver = XRTDEMIterative(
        observed_channel=filters,
        observed_intensities=intensities,
        temperature_responses=responses,
    )

    dem_result = dem_solver.solve()

    dem_result.plot()


Comparison with IDL
-------------------
The Python solver mirrors the SolarSoft/IDL routine 
`xrt_dem_iterative2.pro <https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/hinode/xrt/idl/util/xrt_dem_iterative2.pro>`_.  

While results are consistent, minor differences can occur due to 
interpolation choices and optimization details.


Mathematical Note: Ill-posed Nature of DEM Inversion
----------------------------------------------------
The DEM problem is inherently an **ill-posed mathematical inversion**.  

Given observed intensities :math:`I_i` in channels *i*, and their 
temperature response functions :math:`R_i(T)`, the relationship is:

.. math::

    I_i = \int DEM(T) \, R_i(T) \, dT

Recovering :math:`DEM(T)` from a small set of broadband channels is 
not unique and is technically fraught with perils.  

XRTpy (like the original IDL routine ``xrt_dem_iterative2.pro``) employs a 
**forward-fitting approach**:
- A trial DEM is guessed.
- It is folded through :math:`R_i(T)` to produce "model" intensities.
- The DEM spline points are adjusted to minimize chi-square between model and observed values.

Because the number of temperature bins typically exceeds the number 
of observations, the solution is constrained by assumptions (e.g., 
spline smoothness).  

Uncertainties are estimated through **Monte Carlo iterations**, where 
observations are perturbed by their errors and re-fit. The resulting 
distribution of DEM solutions gives an estimate of confidence.



Example Extension
-----------------
In addition to the required inputs, you can provide optional parameters 
to fine-tune the DEM solution.  
The example below shows all options explicitly set.  

.. code-block:: python

    from xrtpy.xrt_dem_iterative import XRTDEMIterative

    dem_solver = XRTDEMIterative(
        observed_channel=filters,         # Filter names
        observed_intensities=intensities, # Observed values
        temperature_responses=responses,  # Instrument responses

        intensity_errors=errors,   # Obs. uncertainties (default: 3%)
        min_T=5.6,                 # Min log T (default: 5.5)
        max_T=7.8,                 # Max log T (default: 8.0)
        dT=0.05,                   # Bin width in log T (default: 0.1)
        min_error=1.5,             # Minimum error floor (default: 2 DN)
        relative_error=0.02,       # Fractional error scaling (default: 0.03)
        monte_carlo_runs=50,       # # of Monte Carlo runs (default: none)
        max_iterations=3000,       # Solver max iterations (default: 2000)
        solv_factor=1e17,          # Scaling factor (default: 1e21)
    )

.. note::
    The values shown above correspond to existing defaults in the solver, 
    but they are written out here to illustrate what can be tuned.  
    You can adjust these to best suit your analysis needs.  
    This mirrors the flexibility of the IDL routine 
    ``xrt_dem_iterative2.pro``.

    "This notebook is designed as a preliminary guide to handle solar observation data specifically from the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT). While this example does not directly utilize `xrtpy` functionalities, it lays the groundwork for handling and understanding XRT data, which can be further processed and analyzed using `xrtpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll cover:\n",
    "- **Downloading XRT Data**: Step-by-step instructions to download XRT data for a specified period of interest.\n",
    "- **Data Filtering**: Use custom functions for filtering and refining the downloaded data.\n",
    "- **Visualization and Movie Creation**: Explore methods to visualize the data and compile it into movie format, providing a dynamic view of solar observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether for research analysis or as a stepping stone to using `xrtpy` for more advanced applications, this guide aims to equip you with the fundamental skills necessary for effective data manipulation and visualization in solar physics. \n"

    "### Filtering FITS Files by Exposure Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Different exposure times can significantly affect the quality and the type of data captured in each image. This section introduces a method to filter your dataset based on specific exposure time criteria, allowing for a more refined and targeted analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Filter by Exposure Time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering by exposure time can help isolate images that are best suited for your research goals. For instance, shorter exposure times might be preferred for studying rapid solar events, while longer exposures could provide deeper insights into fainter solar features. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor your dataset to include only the most relevant images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter_fits_by_exposure_time` function enables you to specify criteria for selecting images based on their exposure times. You can choose to include images with an exact exposure time, those with exposure times within a specified range, or images with exposure times above or below a certain threshold. This functionality is designed to give you maximum control over the composition of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Exact Match**: Retrieve images with a specific exposure time by entering the exact value in seconds.\n",
    "- **Range Selection**: Specify a range of exposure times to include images that fall within this interval.\n",
    "- **Above or Below a Threshold**: Filter images based on whether their exposure times are above or below a specified value.\n",

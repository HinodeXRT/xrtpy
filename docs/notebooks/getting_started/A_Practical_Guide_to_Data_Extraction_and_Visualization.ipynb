    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed as a preliminary guide to handle solar observation data specifically from the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT). While this example does not directly utilize `xrtpy` functionalities, it lays the groundwork for handling and understanding XRT data, which can be further processed and analyzed using `xrtpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll cover:\n",
    "- **Downloading XRT Data**: Learn how to download XRT data for a specific period of interest.\n",
    "- **Data Filtering**: Use custom functions to filter and process the downloaded data.\n",
    "- **Visualization and Movie Creation**: Explore methods to visualize the data and compile it into movie format, providing a dynamic view of solar observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether for research analysis or as a stepping stone to using `xrtpy` for more advanced applications, this guide aims to equip you with the fundamental skills necessary for effective data manipulation and visualization in solar physics. "

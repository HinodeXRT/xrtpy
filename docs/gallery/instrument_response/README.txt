Instrument Response & Calibration
=================================

These examples illustrate how to evaluate and interpret the XRT instrument's characteristics.

You will learn to work with:
- The instrument's effective area across different filters
- Temperature response functions for solar plasma

This section is helpful for understanding how the instrument "sees" the Sun at different temperatures.

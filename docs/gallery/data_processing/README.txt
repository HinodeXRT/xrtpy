Advanced Data Processing
=========================

This section covers advanced image correction and diagnostic tools.

Examples here show how to:
- Deconvolve images to correct for blurring
- Identify and remove light leaks
- Estimate temperature and emission measure using multi-filter observations

These are core XRTpy functionalities for high-level solar data analysis.

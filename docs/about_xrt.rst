Hinode and the X-Ray Telescope
==============================

Hinode is a joint mission between the space agencies of Japan, United States, Europe, and United Kingdom. The craft carries three instruments, a Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT); together, they are designed to provide multi-wavelength data from the photosphere to the upper corona. The 875-kg craft was launched on September 23, 2006 into a polar, sun-synchronous orbit at 600 kilometers with an inclination of -98â—¦, allowing 9 months of continuous observations and a 3-month eclipse season. Hinode provides approximately 7 GB of data daily.

Information about the Hinode space mission to Sun can be found here. `Hinode information page`_

SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide
============================
The XRT software was created in `Interactive Data Language`_ (IDL). IDL is a software programming language
ysed to anaylsis and create meaningful contron from complex numerical data.

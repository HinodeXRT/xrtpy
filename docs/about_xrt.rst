Hinode 
======
Hinode (`formerly known as Solar-B`_) is a joint mission between the space agencies of Japan, United States, Europe, and United Kingdom. 
The craft carries three instruments, a Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT); together, they are designed to provide multi-wavelength data from the photosphere to the upper corona. The 875-kg craft was launched on September 23, 2006 into a polar, sun-synchronous orbit, allowing for continuous observations of the Sun. Further information can be found at `NASA's Hinode space mission to Sun`_.


The X-Ray Telescope
====================
The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) is an internment onboard the Hinode spacecraft. The XRT will provide 2-arcsecond resolution images of the highest temperature solar coronal material, from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 Kelvin. Visit `xrt-cfa-harvard`_  for mission overview information about the Hinode satellite, the XRT, and much more.

.. tip::
   Please checkout `XRT Picture of the Week`_ and the `Hinode-XRT YouTube`_ page for content about the XRT solar observations. 


SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide
============================
The XRT software was created in Interactive Data Language (IDL). 
IDL is a software programming language used to analyze and create meaningful information from numerical data.
The `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide - Hinode X-Ray Telescope`_ is a guide analyze XRT data in IDL. 
The Software Guide describes how to analyze XRT data; the Instrument Guide gives a broad overview of the X-Ray Telescopeâ€™s hardware components.

.. note::
   The X-Ray Telescope Software Guide not intended to be a guide to use XRTpy.

Hinode
======
Hinode (`formerly known as Solar-B`_) is a joint mission between the space agencies of Japan, United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.
The spacecraft carries three instruments: the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT). These
instruments are designed to provide multi-wavelength data from the photosphere to the upper corona. The 875-kg spacecraft was launched on September 23, 2006, into a polar,
sun-synchronous orbit, enabling continuous observations of the Sun. Further information can be found at `NASA's Hinode space mission to the Sun`_.


The X-Ray Telescope
====================
The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) is an instrument onboard the Hinode spacecraft. With its remarkable capabilities, the XRT provides high-resolution
images of the solar corona's hottest material, ranging from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 Kelvin. Visit the official `xrt-cfa-harvard`_ website for mission overview information about the XRT.

.. tip::
   Visit the `XRT Picture of the Week`_ and the `Hinode-XRT YouTube`_ page for captivating visual content showcasing the XRT's solar observations.


SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide
============================
The `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ is a comprehensive resource for analyze the XRT data.
It includes both an Instrument Guide and an overview of the X-Ray telescope's hardware components.
The XRT software was originally created in Interactive Data Language (IDL).
IDL is a software programming language used to analyze and create meaningful information from numerical data.


.. note::
   Please note that the `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ does not serve as a guide for using XRTpy.
   It focuses solely on the analysis of XRT data and the associated software tools.

Hinode
======
Hinode (`formerly known as Solar-B`_) is a joint mission between the space agencies of Japan, United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.
The spacecraft carries three instruments, a Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT); together,
they are designed to provide multi-wavelength data from the photosphere to the upper corona. The 875-kg spacecraft was launched on September 23, 2006 into a polar,
sun-synchronous orbit, allowing for continuous observations of the Sun. Further information can be found at `NASA's Hinode space mission to the Sun`_.


The X-Ray Telescope
====================
The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) is an instrument onboard the Hinode spacecraft. The XRT provides 2-arcsecond resolution images of the highest temperature solar coronal
material, from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 Kelvin. Visit the official `xrt-cfa-harvard`_ website for mission overview information about the XRT.

.. tip::
   Visit the `XRT Picture of the Week`_ and the `Hinode-XRT YouTube`_ page for content about the XRT solar observations.


SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide
============================
The `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ is a guide to analyze the XRT data.
The Software Guide consists of the Instrument Guide and a broad overview of the X-Ray telescopeâ€™s hardware components.
The XRT software was originally created in Interactive Data Language (IDL).
IDL is a software programming language used to analyze and create meaningful information from numerical data.


.. note::
   The `SolarSoft XRT Analysis Guide`_ is not intended to be a guide to use XRTpy.

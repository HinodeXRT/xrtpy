Code of Conduct
*******************

XRTpy follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, which is a widely adopted standard for fostering an inclusive
and respectful community. Below are the key principles and standards that all contributors and community members are
expected to adhere to.

Our Pledge
==========
We, as contributors and maintainers of XRTpy, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

Respectful Communication
=========================
We expect all participants to communicate respectfully and constructively. This includes being polite, considerate, and welcoming,
while avoiding any form of harassment, discrimination, or offensive behavior.

Diversity and Inclusion
=========================
XRTpy values diversity and is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds,
regardless of gender, disability, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

Constructive Criticism
=========================
Feedback is essential for the growth and improvement of XRTpy. We encourage everyone to provide and receive feedback in a constructive manner.
Criticism should focus on improving the project and fostering learning, with an emphasis on what is best for the overall community.

Conflict Resolution and Enforcement
=====================================
Conflicts may arise in any collaborative environment. Participants should engage respectfully and with an open mind.
If unresolved, project maintainers will mediate to ensure a fair resolution. Violations of this Code of Conduct will result
in appropriate consequences, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal. Community leaders are responsible for
enforcing these rules and taking corrective action as needed.

**Enforcement and Reporting**

- Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at xrtpy@cfa.harvard.edu. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
- Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.


This Code of Conduct is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant`_, version 2.1.

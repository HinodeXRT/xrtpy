Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of XRTpy, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to ensuring respectful interactions across all roles and backgrounds, regardless of personal characteristics or beliefs. This includes, but is not limited to, differences in age, background, education, technical experience, nationality, religion, or personal identity.

XRTpy welcomes contributions from a wide range of perspectives and values collaborative, constructive input from everyone involved.

Respectful Communication

We expect all participants to communicate respectfully and constructively.
This includes being polite, considerate, and welcoming, while avoiding any form of harassment, discrimination, or offensive behavior.

Constructive Criticism
======================

Feedback is essential for the growth and improvement of XRTpy.
We encourage everyone to provide and receive feedback in a constructive manner.
Criticism should focus on improving the project and fostering learning, with an emphasis on what is best for the overall community.

Conflict Resolution and Enforcement
===================================

Conflicts may arise in any collaborative environment.
We ask participants to engage respectfully and with an open mind.
If unresolved, project maintainers will mediate to ensure a fair resolution.
Violations of this Code of Conduct will result in appropriate consequences, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal.
Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this code and taking appropriate action.
